# Project: Mapping Web - Visualizing Data with Leaflet
This project uses an API from USGS, which provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. In this project, I am using a GeoJSON format from a data set 'All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days'.

## Webpage and coding
This project has two different mapping, each one has a separated folder in this repository.

This mapping below shows the position of the earthquake. The markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color.
