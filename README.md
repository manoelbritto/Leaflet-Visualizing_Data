# Project: Mapping Web - Visualizing Data with Leaflet
This project uses an API from USGS, which provides earthquake data in several different formats, updated every 5 minutes. In this project, I am using a GeoJSON format from a data set 'All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days'.

## Webpage and coding
This project has two different maps, and each one has a separated folder in this repository.

This mapping below shows the position of the earthquake. The markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color.

Another map illustrates the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. Moreover, you can interact on the page, turn on, or turn off the layers. 
Besides, the data on tectonic plates can be found [here](https://github.com/manoelbritto/Leaflet-Visualizing_Data/tree/master/Leaflet-Step-2/static/data)
